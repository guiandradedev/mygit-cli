# MyGit CLI

A simple Git CLI that helps users create well-formatted commit messages with ease. This tool simplifies the process of making meaningful commits by allowing users to choose commit types and add detailed commit messages.

## Technologies

- Python3
- VSCode (or any other code editor)

## How to Install

To install and use the **MyGit CLI**, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)

If you're getting this tool from a Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guiandradedev/mygit-cli.git
cd mygit-cli
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Apply Alias

This set of commands works only on macOS/Linux:

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following line:
```bash
alias mgt="python3 /path/to/mygitcli/mgt.py"
```

Save and apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can enjoy the app:
```bash
mgt c -t feat -m "commit by alias"
```

## How to Use

Once installed, you can use the **MyGit CLI** to easily commit changes to your Git repository with custom messages.

### Command Syntax

```bash
mgt c
```

### Options:

- `-t` or `--type`: The type of the commit (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.). If not provided, you'll be prompted to select from a list of common commit types.
- `-m` or `--message`: The commit message. If not provided, you'll be prompted to enter one.
- `-c` or `--content`: Files to include in the commit. You can specify multiple files by repeating the flag.
- `--dry`: If set, will only display the commands without executing them.

### Example Usage:

1. **Basic commit:**

```bash
mgt c -t feat -m "Add new feature"
```

2. **Commit with content (files):**

```bash
mgt c -t fix -m "Fix bug in feature" -c file1.py file2.py
```

3. **Dry-run commit (no changes made):**

```bash
mgt c -t chore -m "Update README" --dry
```

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
